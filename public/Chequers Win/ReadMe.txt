CHESSICONS V4 - BONUS SET: CHEQUERS

This set of 12 Windows icons is based on the designs used in two of my wallpapers, 'Gold Chequers' and 'Blue Chequers', found on the site virtualpieces.net. As with other icons from Chessicons V4, six image resolutions are supported - 256x256, 128x128, 48x48, 32x32, 24x24, and 16x16 pixels. I created the icons using IcoFX, an icon editor, and Paint.NET, a graphics editor, both excellent softwares.

Chessicons V4 is freeware for personal, non-commercial use. Any other use, including display on websites and redistribution, requires my permission. If you have any comments, suggestions, or requests, feel free to email me.
